# Super Mario Re-implementation Project
Super Mario Re-Implementation Project (SMRP) is a student project to recreate the first world of Super Mario Bros. using Unity.*Super Mario Bros.* is a game developed by Nintendo for the NES launched in 1985. It received a visual overhaul and was relaunched for the SNES in 1993 as part of the *Super Mario All-Stars* collection. We'll use the SNES version as an inspiration for this project.

## Project goals
* Implement a Super Mario-like platform engine using Unity
* Learn how to use sounds, deal with collision, lives, scores, camera and other aspects of platform games
* Get a platform game with 4 courses complete by June 2018

## What this project is NOT meant to do
* A pixel perfect clone of Super Mario Bros.
* A project with original assets - we plan on reutilizing existent ones, preferably from the official games

## How this repository is organized
* README.md contains general information
* `/src` folder contains Unity files with source code
* `/assets` folder contains graphic and audio assets for use. You can take them from here to use with Unity
* `/doc` folder contains documentation regarding planning, design decisions, asset usage and others
