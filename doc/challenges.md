# Challenges

This document describes what kind of challenges we faced when developing this project. This document will be continuously updated until the game is finished.

## Technical difficulties

#### Lack of a senior figure
Some technical difficulties could easily be solved if we had someone more experienced with Unity for immediate consult. Although we haven't seen anything yet we couldn't eventually figure out, the time spent looking for guides and reading questions in forums could be better used implementing features and fixing bugs.

#### Lack of experience with C Sharp
Two members had zero experience with C Sharp before they started using Unity. Despite the fact they had previous experience with programming, learning Unity also meant learning C Sharp from scratch, and that includes spending time fixing many syntax errors.

#### Lack of specific tutorials for Mario games
Compared to other game making tools, we couldn't find tutorials that taught how to make a *Super Mario Bros.-like* game using Unity. All tutorials we found were either for generic platform games (which did help us get started) or 3D tutorials directed towards advanced users.
