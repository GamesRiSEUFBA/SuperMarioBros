# Game Design

This document is a textual description of *Super Mario Bros.*'s mechanics and characteristics we plan to implement into our game.

### Gameplay
*Super Mario Bros.* set the standards for what is considered a typical 2D platform game. The player may uses 2 directional buttons to move horizontally until he hits a solid block. He may also press a button to jump or keep pressing another button to start running. Occasionally, the player may use 2 directional buttons to move vertically (for example, pressing "down" to go down through a pipe).

The camera follows Mario, always leaving him in the center of the screen except on the course's borders. The player beats the game by getting to the end of all courses. Through each course, the player finds enemies, some "killable" and some not. The "killable" enemies are normally killed by jumping on top of them, and they may damage Mario by touching him any other way.

If Mario is damaged, the player loses a life and the course restarts. However, Mario may get "power ups" through the course, which makes him stronger. If he is "powered up" when he gets touched by an enemy, instead of dying he returns to his small form and becomes immune to damage for 3 seconds. This immunity doesn't prevent him from dying falling to the bottom of the course, however.

If the player loses all his lives, the game shows a "Game Over" screen and restarts.
