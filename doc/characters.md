# Characters

This document describes all characters that could and should be present in this remake of *Super Mario Bros.*. Each character has a generic description about the character itself, plus a description about what they do in-game.

## Main characters

### Mario
Mario is the leading character in the *Mario* franchise. He's a pumbler who lives in the Mushroom Kingdom, the main setting of most Mario games. After hearding about the Princess Toadstool's kidnapping, he goes on an adventure to save her with his brother, *Luigi*.

Gameplay-wise, Mario is a character controlled by the player. He can move in both directions (by pressing direction keys), run (by pressing the "Run" button) and jump (by pressing the jump button). Mario has **four** different forms in *Super Mario Bros.*:
    * *Small Mario*, the form which he starts the game with. Small Mario can't break blocks and will die if colliding sideways with an enemy or colliding in any way with fire or Bowser himself.
    * *Big Mario* is the form *Small Mario* becomes after he eats a Red Mushroom. Big Mario can break blocks by jumping below them. If he suffers any kind of damage, he will turn into "Small Mario" and become invulnerable for 3 seconds. This invulnerability doesn't prevent him from falling into cliffs.
    * *Fire Mario* is the form *Small Mario* or *Big Mario* becomes after coming into contact with a Fire Flower. Fire Mario can throw up to 2 fire balls at the same time by pressing the Run button. If he suffers any kind of damage, he'll turn into Big Mario and become invulnerable for 3 seconds.
    * *Invencible Mario* is a temporary form which Small Mario, Big Mario or Fire Mario becomes invencible for 15 seconds after touching a Star. Any enemy that touches Invencible Mario is instantly killed. Invencible Mario still dies to cliffs.

### Luigi
Luigi is Mario's brother and goes with him in his journey to save Princess Toadstool. He wears green clothes and is taller than his brother.

Gameplay-wise, Luigi plays exactly the same as Mario in *Super Mario Bros.*. Features that change his gameplay in comparison with his brother were only introduced with *Super Mario Bros. 2*.

### Princess Toadstool
Princess Toadstool, often called *Princess Peach*, is the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. She was kidnapped by Bowser Koopa, the main villain.

Gameplay-wise, she is a NPC that shows up in the last castle of *Super Mario Bros.*, rewarding the players with a kiss after they beat the game.

### Bowser Koopa
Bowser Koopa, or just *Bowser* is the main villain of *Super Mario Bros.*. He kidnapped Princess Toadstool and brought her to a faraway castle of his own.

Gameplay-wise, Bowser is an enemy present in the end of every castle (levels ending with "4"). In the first 7 worlds, the player fights against Bowser clones, and only in World 8 he fights against the true Bowser Koopa.

He moves horizontally and attacks the player by breathing fire. His attacks can be seen early at level 1-4, before the player actually meets him. Bowser damages the player in any kind of contact, and can only be defeated by throwing tons of fireballs (>10) or by having Mario/Luigi touching an Axe located behind him. By touching it, the player will throw Bowser into a lava sea.

### Toad
Toad is a character from a species of the same name.

Gameplay-wise, a different Toad is present in the first 7 castles of Super Mario Bros.

## Common enemies

### Goomba
Goomba is a small, brown creature that is about the same size as Small Mario. Lore-wise, most Goombas work for Bowser.

Gameplay-wise, Goomba is the first enemy Mario/Luigi encounters in *Super Mario Bros.*. It can be killed by jumping on top of it. It only moves horizontally, and will fall in a cliff if he walks torwards one. Goombas DO colide with each other, and with other enemies, and both change directions when it happens.

### Koopa Troopa
Koopa Troopas are turtle-like creatures that live in the Mushroom Kingdom. Most of them serve Bowser Koopa.

Gameplay-wise, Koopa Troopas move horizontally just like a Goomba. However, by jumping on them, they turn into a shell that can be kicked by Mario. When the shell is sliding, it can kill other enemies or Mario himself. Green Koopas fall for cliffs, while Red Koopas change their direction when finding one.

### Piranha Plant
Piranha Plants are plants that look like carnivoral plants.

Gameplay-wise, they hide in certain pipes and appear when Mario looks the other way. They only move vertically in *Super Mario Bros.*.
